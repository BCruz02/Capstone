#### By Brandon Cruz  

## Question  
### "Which countries have contributed most to U.S. tourism, and how has international visitation to the U.S. changed over the past 10 years?"  

## Why  
### 1. To gain insights into how U.S. tourism has evolved over the past decade, highlighting trends before COVID-19, during the pandemic, and throughout the post-COVID recovery period.  
### 2. To develop a clear visual representation identifying which countries contribute most to U.S. tourism.  
### 3. To evaluate whether international tourism is trending upward, declining, or remaining stable over time.

- This project utilizes data from the **International Trade Administration**, available here: [International Visitor Arrivals Program](https://www.trade.gov/i-94-arrivals-program).  
  - The dataset is provided in an Excel format.  
  - It records international visitors entering the United States who stayed for at least one night and entered under specific visa categories (such as tourism, student, or business travel).  

### 2. Data Manipulation  
- **Tools Used:**  
  - Excel  
  - Pandas  
  - Jupyter Notebooks  

### 3. Coding Process  
- **Development Environment:**  
  - VS Code  
  - Python  

### 4. Visualizations  
- Tableau
