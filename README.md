# *History of United States Toursit Arrivals* 
#### By Brandon Cruz

## Question: 
### Which countries have contributed most to U.S tourism, and ho has international visitation to the U.S changed over the past 10 years?

## Tools Used: 
- Excel
- Python
- Tableau
  
## Details: 
#### **Why?** As a person who loves to travel, I wanted to look inside of the U.S and explore how international visitation patterns have shifted over the past dacade. Tourism has always been a major contribtutor to the U.S economy and influences a variety of sectors and therefore I wanted to see the current and past landscape of tourism in the U.S. 

#### **Raw Data:** I found the dataset here: [International Visitor Arrivals Program](https://www.trade.gov/i-94-arrivals-program). It's a government dataset with every international visitor who has entered the U.S for at least one night and with a valid Visa. The data is an excel file and has data going all the way back to 2000. 

#### **Cleanig** I used python to do the following:
- Importing dataset 
- Rename columns
- Drop unessesary rows (years)
- Reshaped dataset to be formatted the long way

#### **Hypothesis:** 
- Prior to my analysis, I thought the major region of where visitors would be from would be Europe. I was expecting to see "rich" countries such as the U.K, Germany, France, Spain, to have the most number of visitors in the U.S.  
- Prior to my analysis, I was expecting to see tourism numbers to show a steady increase until 2020 followed by a sharp decline during the pandemic, then gradual recovery in recent years. 

#### **Findings:** After analsing the data and visualizing the results in Tableau, severl key insights emerged: 
- Canada and Mexico were te largest contributors to U.S toruism across the decade, consistently ranking at the top. 
- Covid did in fact result in a huge decline in tourism. However the rebound was far sharper than I expected. 
- Overseas tourims hasn't fullly recovered. They are no where close to reaching pre covid levels. This shows that oversea regions arent as interested in visiting the U.S as they once where. 
- Canada and Mexico were the dominant contributors to U.S tourism over the past decade. Top three contribtors:
    - Canada: ~ 163 million visitors
    - Mexico: ~ 157 millino visitors
    - U.K: ~ 38 million visitors
- The U.K's total visitation is less than one-fourth of that of Mexico's. Underscoring how geographic procimit and ease of travel heavily influence U.S tourims volume. 

#### **Summary:** Neighboring countries make more than 50% of our tourism. And overseas visitation hasn't fully recovered.
